# colorful-.bashrc
this program is used to solve confusion when using SSH to remote control device
apply the same .bashrc and the script, devicecolor in all the computer you'll ssh to

for example, if the hostname is contain the word red,
then the terminal will show the hostname's text in red, simple

this works if
  the computer name contain some color related words listed inside the script, devicecolor
and if
  devicecolor is executable and is inside a directry of environment path

the .bashrc is generated by ubuntu, and edited to use the script, devicecolor
also, this won't work in WSL, I don't know why
