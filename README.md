# colorful-.bashrc
this short program is added inside .bashrc to solve confusion when using SSH to remote control device

making hostname highly distinguishable by showing the hostname's text in a color described in hostname itself

for example, if the hostname is contain the word "red",
then the terminal will show the hostname's text in red, very simple

apply the same .bashrc in all the device you'll ssh to

this works if
  the computer name contain some color-related words listed inside the .bashrc (starting from line 8)
but if the hostname contain no color-related words listed, then it have no effect


the .bashrc is edited from one generated by ubuntu
