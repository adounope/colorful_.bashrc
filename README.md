# colorful-.bashrc
this short program is used to solve confusion when using SSH to remote control device

making hostname highly distinguishable by showing the hostname's text in a color described in hostname itself

for example, if the hostname is contain the word "red",
then the terminal will show the hostname's text in red, very simple

apply the same .bashrc and the script, devicecolor in all the device you'll ssh to


this works if
  the computer name contain some color-related words listed inside the script, devicecolor
but if the hostname contain no color-related words, then it have no effect
and if
  devicecolor is executable and is inside a directry of environment path


the .bashrc is generated by ubuntu, and edited to use the script, devicecolor
also, this won't work in WSL, I don't know why
